# Minimal 3D engine demonstration on RISC-V GD32V

A fairly small "3D engine" implemented on GD32VF103. <10KB footprint in flash (likely a lot less, haven't had the time to properly check). Most of the interesting code is in either **src/app.c**, **lib/lcd/include/v3de.h** or **lib/lcd/src/v3de.c**
